Grover Command Descriptions

Documentation of CPE 350/450 Spring 2020 Grover Command Controls
Explains what the commands do and how to use them

- All commands are NOT case sensitive, but spelling and spacing are
-  < > denotes an optional value the user can include (do not include <> as part of the command)
- userValue indicates the value is supplied by the user

Calibration Commands

calibrate

Calibrates all corner articulation wheels, starting at the front right, then goes clockwise. Used to determine corner wheel centers, get right and left-most positions, and calculates wheel factor. 


calibrate fr

Calibrates the front right wheel only.


calibrate br

Calibrates the back right wheel only.


calibrate fl

Calibrates the front left wheel only.


calibrate bl

Calibrates the back left wheel only.


recenter 

WARNING: not functional and will get stuck in an infinite loop if called. Use at your own risk.
Recenters the wheels from any position: turns all wheels to the left-most position, then to the right until they reach their centers.

Movement Commands

forward userSpeed userDistance 
backward userSpeed userDistance

Drives the rover straight forward or backward at a user specified velocity and distance. This command assumes the wheels are all positioned in their center positions ± 10% error rate. All wheels spin at the same rate where the max speed is capped. If max/min values incorrectly entered, an error message is printed.

userSpeed →  velocity,  0 - 0.1 m/s
userDistance →  distance to travel (> 0) in meters



arc turn userDriveDirection userTurnDirection userSpeed <userDistance>

Turns then drives the rover in the user defined directions and speed. The user can specify an optional distance for the rover to travel.

If a distance is not included or 0 is entered, the rover will enter free range mode. It will drive at the user entered parameters and the terminal will prompt a stop? query. When the rover has traveled to the user’s desired destination, enter y to stop the rover. 
If a distance is included, the rover will enter confined mode. It will drive at the user entered parameters until the specified distance is reached.

userDriveDirection →  forward or backward
userTurnDirection →  right or left
userSpeed →  velocity,  0 - 0.1 m/s
userDistance →  optional distance to travel in meters
		⇒    < 0:   error printed
		⇒    0 or nothing:  free range mode
⇒    > 0:  confined mode 


Prototypes
Semi-functional but unreliable commands in commands file, but require further testing

recenter prototype

Another recenter command using the wheel’s full range of encoder values.  Determines the wheels’ current configuration and turns them in the direction needed to reach their center.
